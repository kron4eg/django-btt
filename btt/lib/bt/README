Bencoding Implementation
========================

This is a simple implementation of Bencoding, data-description format, used by
Torrent. This implementation is aimed to be clear and good structured (in order
to be easy understanable), not the most efficient one, keep that in mind. 

Usage:

    >>> data = [1, 2, 3, {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}, 'just a string here']

    >>> encoded = encode(data)
    >>> encoded
    'li1ei2ei3ed4:key16:value14:key26:value2e18:just a string heree'

    >>> decoded = decode(encoded)
    >>> decoded
    [1, 2, 3, {'key2': 'value2', 'key1': 'value2'}, 'just a string here']

    >>> data == decoded
    True
